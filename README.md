# MultiplayerBasePlugin
 Multiplayer Subsystem UE5 to host and join via basic steam subsystem as a plugin
-Use of Dynamic and NonDynamic Multicast delegates
-Use of Delegates and handles provided by ISessionPtr Interface
-Binding widgets with C++ for easier access and less use of Blueprints
-Server and Client Travel

I am using this base plugin for 3 of my private projects. In future I will probably move this to EOS instead of Steam but for now, it's good enough.
